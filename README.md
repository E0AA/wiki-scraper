# wiki-scraper
Wikipedia article scraper written in Python.

The program will iterate over all of the wikipedia articles by their ID and pull all of the text from it and appends it to a file. The program also keeps logs of the scraping so if the program crashes (which is unlikeley) you can continue from where it crashed.
